# NLP-ChicagoFoodInspections-Tokenization
This project is one of NLP project series using food inspections dataset from the Chicago Department of Public Healthâ€™s Food Protection Program. This goal is to improve the accuracy of failed food inspections I've produced from "NLP-ChicagoFoodInspections-Python" by identifying specific tokens that lead to failed food inspections in Chicago.
